//how i enabled printing
services.printing.drivers = [ YOUR_DRIVER ];

where YOUR_DRIVER is the driver package appropriate for your printer. the one i used is:
    pkgs.hplip — Drivers for HP printers.
    pkgs.hplipWithPlugin — Drivers for HP printers, with the proprietary plugin. Use NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1 nix-shell -p hplipWithPlugin --run 'sudo -E hp-setup' to add the printer, regular CUPS UI doesn't seem to work.

and yes, i had to do hp-setup
